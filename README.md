# Predict-Movie-Box-Office-Revenue-with-Linear-Regression

In this project I used the data of the biggest budget movies.
I took it from https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets

Then I clean this data table by remove missing data, incomplete data, inaccurate data and formatting

Then after visualizing these data I use linear regression to predict the review according to its budget.
